<div class="para"><h2>俱乐部生涯</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2019年对于梅西而言是悲喜交加的一年，却也是他个人职业生涯重上高峰，值得铭记的一年。在2019年他和巴塞罗那一起获得西甲冠军、西班牙超级杯冠军。这一年阿根廷人共打入54粒进球，贡献23次助攻，获得欧冠最佳射手、西甲射手王和助攻王、欧洲金靴、西甲最佳球员和欧足联年度最佳前锋，稍早还力压范戴克成为2019FIFA足球先生。</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;世界足坛2019年金球奖在法国颁出，效力于巴塞罗那俱乐部的阿根廷球星梅西力压范戴克当选。这是梅西生涯第六次捧起金球奖，独占历史第一。 上赛季，梅西代表俱乐部出战50场，贡献51球和22次助攻，率队获得西甲冠军等头衔，个人收获欧冠最佳射手、欧洲金靴等荣誉。在结果揭晓前，外界普遍认为范戴克与梅西是最有力的竞争者。此前梅西已获选FIFA世界足球先生，同时将欧洲金靴奖收入囊中。范戴克帮助利物浦重夺欧冠冠军，并当选欧足联年度最佳球员。</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;梅西和C罗是金球奖有史以来获得次数最多的球员，两人都分别拿过5个金球。自2008年起，两人开始了长达10年的“二人转”垄断，但这一态势去年被打破。2018年金球奖属于皇马的克罗地亚中场莫德里奇，C罗排名第二获得银球，巴萨的法国前锋格里兹曼排在第三，梅西无缘三甲。最终，梅西如愿当选，范戴克位列第2。此前连续8年位列金球奖前两位的C罗，在本年度评选中排名第3。进入前5的还有马内与萨拉赫，他们的利物浦队友阿利森排名第7。 “能成为巴萨历史的一部分很美妙，这是世界上最好的俱乐部，这是我爱的俱乐部，也是我的无上荣耀。”在获奖后，梅西如是说。他还表示，希望在未来的职业生涯中帮助国家队和俱乐部获得更多荣誉。 </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;梅西刚刚完成为巴塞罗那出战700场的里程碑。在这700场比赛中，梅西总共打入613粒进球、送出237记助攻，场均制造1.2球。在帮助俱乐部赢得34座冠军奖杯的同时，梅西个人6次当选世界足球先生、6次捧起金球奖。对于32岁的梅西而言，这些数字是暂时的，他还有足够的时间将荣誉继续提升至新的高度。 </p>

Van Dijk helped Liverpool regain the Champions League title and was selected as UEFA Player of the Year.</p>
<p class="enfz">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are the players who have won the Golden Globes the most times in history. Both have won 5 Golden Globes. Since 2008, the two have started a 10-year "two-person transfer" monopoly, but this situation was broken last year. The 2018 Golden Globes belonged to Real Madrid's Croatian midfielder Modric, Ronaldo ranked second to get the silver ball, Barcelona's French striker Griezmann ranked third, and Messi missed the top three. In the end, Messi was elected as he wished and Van Dyke ranked second. Cristiano Ronaldo, who ranked in the top two for the Golden Globes for eight consecutive years, ranked third in this year's selection. Entering the top 5 are Mane and Salah, their Liverpool teammate Allison ranked seventh. "It's wonderful to be a part of Barcelona's history. This is the best club in the world. This is the club I love and the supreme glory." Messi said after the award. He also stated that he hopes to help the national team and club gain more honors in their future careers.</p>
