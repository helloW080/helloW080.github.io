<div class="para"><h2>世界杯</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;对于所有球员来说，能够捧起大力神杯，那都是至高无上的荣誉，强如梅罗，都未曾染指过世界杯冠军，这些年来的奋斗，一直都没能让他们可以更进一步。2014年巴西世界杯，梅西率领阿根廷闯入了决赛，这也是梅西距离大力神杯最近的一刻，只可惜最终还是无缘此奖，替补登场的22岁小将格策，于禁区底线胸部停球随后一记垫射，直接击碎了梅西的世界杯冠军梦，而梅西与大力神杯擦肩而过的那一幕，成为了世界杯历史上永恒的经典回忆。</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;每当提及这一场比赛，梅西内心都是非常复杂的，在最近接受阿根廷媒体TyC体育采访的时候，梅西也表达了自己对世界杯冠军的无比渴望，他非常希望自己可以成为世界冠军，但并不会用职业生涯里任何东西去交换，只有凭自己能力拿到的，才是最好的。或许在2014年世界杯遭遇德国淘汰之后，大力神杯距离梅西也已经渐行渐远，如今想要再一次近距离接触，也已经变得不那么现实了。”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;值得一提的是，曾在2016年接受采访的时候，就有记者提及了5座金球奖和1座世界杯冠军之间的选择，而梅西并没有做出任何的思考，直言如果可以，他更倾向于选择世界杯冠军，因为金球奖是个人荣誉，世界杯是团队荣誉，在足球运动之中，团队荣誉往往要比个人荣誉更加重要。当然，这也只是假设性的选择题而已，梅西已经没有任何选择的余地，世界杯冠军，似乎注定与他无缘。</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;现在的阿根廷队已经今非昔比，18年艰难挺进淘汰赛后直接被法国淘汰，今年美洲4强赛出局后，我们又再一次看到了梅西充满绝望的眼神，效力国家队多年，没能带来半点荣誉，也是梅西职业生涯以来久久挥之不去的痛。昔日长发飘飘过五关斩六将的阿根廷少年，如今脸上也已经布满了胡子，32岁的梅西，未来2022年卡塔尔世界杯，又将会出现什么样的结局？5年前或许所有阿根廷球迷和梅西球迷都非常期待看到他们获得世界杯冠军，但现在，或许连想也已经变成了奢望。</p>

<p class="enfz">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all players, being able to hold the Hercules Cup is the supreme honor, as strong as Merrow, has never been involved in the World Cup championship, the struggle over the years has not allowed them to go further. In the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Messi led Argentina to the final. This is also the closest Messi has to the Hercules Cup, but unfortunately he still missed the award in the end. The 22-year-old teenager Gotse, who came off the bench, stopped the ball at the bottom of the penalty area. A single shot directly broke the dream of Messi's World Cup champion, and the scene where Messi passed the Hercules Cup became an eternal classic memory in the history of the World Cup.</p><p class="enfz">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When mentioning this game, Messi is very complicated inside. In a recent interview with the Argentine media TyC Sports, Messi also expressed his insatiable desire for the World Cup championship. He very much hoped that he could become a world champion , But it will not be exchanged for anything in your career. Only the ones you can get by yourself are the best. Perhaps after the World Cup in 2014, Germany was eliminated, Hercules Cup has gradually drifted away from Messi, and now it is not so realistic to want to have a close contact again. "</p>
<p class="enfz">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth mentioning that in an interview in 2016, a reporter mentioned the choice between 5 Golden Globes and 1 World Cup winner, and Messi did not make any thoughts, and frankly, if you can, He prefers to choose the World Cup champion because the Golden Globe is a personal honor and the World Cup is a team honor. In football, team honors are often more important than personal honors. Of course, this is only a hypothetical multiple choice question. Messi has no choice. The World Cup champion seems destined to miss him.</p>
<p class="enfz">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Argentine team is not the same as it was now. After 18 years of difficult progress into the knockout match, it was directly eliminated by France. After this year's quarter-finals in the Americas, we once again saw Messi's desperate eyes. A little bit of honor is also the lingering pain since Messi's career. The young Argentinean boy with long hair flying past five levels and six generals, now has a beard on his face, 32-year-old Messi, what will happen in the next 2022 Qatar World Cup? Five years ago, perhaps all Argentine fans and Lionel Messi fans were very much looking forward to seeing them win the World Cup, but now, maybe even their imagination has become a luxury.</p>
